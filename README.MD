# Debugging

In this lecture we talk about debugging practices.

`Debugging` is the process of identifying and removing errors from software.

This term originated in 1940 from Admiral Grace Hopper who was working on the Mark II computer at Harvard and found a Moth inside of the machine. When they removed the moth they delcared they were "debugging" the system.
